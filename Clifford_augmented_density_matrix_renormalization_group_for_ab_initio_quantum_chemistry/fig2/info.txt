Each file contains the following columns:
- Col1: Bond dimension (chi)
- Col2: 1/chi, used as x-axis
- Col3: Ground state energy obtained using CA-DMRG
- Col4: Absolute error calculated as |Col3 - FCI energy|, painted red in figures 
- Col5: Ground state energy obtained using DMRG
- Col6: Absolute error calculated as |Col5 - FCI energy|, painted blue in figures
FCI energy is indicated in the first header row in each file.
All energies are in unit Hartree. Errors invisible from the axis range are left blank (as --) for ease in creating figures.
