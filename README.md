### Data for our published paper on the quantum chemistry solvers

This is a repository for data presented in the manuscript: *Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for* ab initio *quantum chemistry* (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.16026). Each folder contains the data needed to create the corresponding figure.

Figures used in this manuscript are created using the Origin software. Each `.dat` file given here contains data from the worksheets that are needed for creating the plots. Header lines are added to make them more readable. Further information for each file are provided as `info.txt`  in the corresponding folder. The figures can be recreated by importing the data files back into Origin and plotting corresponding columns.
