### Data for our published paper on the quantum chemistry solvers

This is a repository for data presented in the manuscript: *Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for* ab initio *quantum chemistry* (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.16026). Each folder contains the data needed to create the corresponding figure.

Figures used in this manuscript were created using the Origin software. Each `.dat` file provided here contains data from the worksheets that are required to generate the plots. Header lines have been added to improve readability. Further information about each file is provided in the corresponding folder as `info.txt`. The figures can be recreated by importing the data files back into Origin and plotting the corresponding columns.

For convenience, we also include Python scripts that plot the figures using the `.dat` files, although the formatting may differ from the original figures used in the manuscript.
